# Satellite-signals
My major project was on developing an autonomous Yagi antenna for satellite tracking. I worked with a team of four on this project, and it was inspired by my hobby of looking at satellite images on the internet. I wanted to be able to capture my own satellite images.

I started by using a simple V-dipole antenna, but I encountered problems with noise and image quality. I then switched to a Yagi antenna, which is a more directional antenna that can improve image quality.

I also developed a software program to control the antenna and track satellites. This program uses the NOAA satellite tracking data to calculate the antenna's orientation.

I was able to successfully track and capture images from NOAA satellites. However, I was still working on automating the entire process at the time of writing the project report.

Overall, my major project was a successful attempt to develop an autonomous Cross-Yagi antenna for satellite tracking. I made significant progress towards this goal, and my work has the potential to be used by other hobbyists and researchers.

I am proud of what I accomplished with this project, and I am excited to see how it can be used in the future.
